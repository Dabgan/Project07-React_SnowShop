# SnowShop

This project is an online shop with snowboard equipment, based on the React.js library. Check the live version [here](https://snow-shop.netlify.app).

The basic assumptions were to create imitation of an online shop where you can select and sort products at categories / prices and then add them to your shopping cart. The shopping cart is based on localStorage.

## Technologies

In this project I used:

-   [React](https://pl.reactjs.org/)
-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as my backend
-   [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/) to build the forms and validate them
-   [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) to style some of the components (Navbar, Hamburger menu and shopping path)
-   Some other minor packages like: node-sass, react-icon, react-scroll-up-button, react-tostify

## What did I learn?

-   what React Hooks are and how to use them, so almost the entire page is written based on hooks
-   how to create and use my own Hooks
-   what Styled-Components are and why it is so convenient to use them
-   how to manage routes and page rendering with react-router
-   how to use terminal for Git instead of GUI
-   how to work with a database (firebase)
-   how to properly import images/fonts/icons in React
